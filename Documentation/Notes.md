# Logging

There are two kinds of logs available:

- ac.log which logs to py_log.txt. This persists after the session is ended.
- ac.console which logs to log.txt and is available via the console (Home key) in game. This persists only while running.

See logs at C:\User\My Documents\Assetto Corsa\logs\
